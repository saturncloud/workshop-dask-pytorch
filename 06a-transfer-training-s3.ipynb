To do this, we are using the `DDP()` wrapper around the model, which is short for the PyTorch function `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`. There is a lot to know about this, but for our purposes the important thing is to understand that this allows the model training to run in parallel on our cluster. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/ddp.html\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussing DDP\n",
    "It's helpful to know what this framework is really doing under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official PyTorch documentation tells us this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">This container parallelizes the application of the given module by splitting the input across the specified devices by chunking in the batch dimension (other objects will be copied once per device). In the forward pass, the module is replicated on each device, and each replica handles a portion of the input. During the backwards pass, gradients from each replica are summed into the original module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear as mud, right? Let’s try to break it down.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This container parallelizes the application of the given module\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just indicating that we’re parallelizing a deep learning workflow — transfer learning in our case.\n",
    "\n",
    ">by splitting the input across the specified devices by chunking in the batch dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "Input for a transfer learning workflow is the dataset! Ok, so it is chunking our image batches and that’s what gets to be parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    ">(other objects will be copied once per device)\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg, our starting model, if any (Resnet50 for us) doesn’t get broken up at all. Good to know.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the forward pass, the module is replicated on each device, and each replica handles a portion of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so the training task, our module, is replicated on each device. We have multiple copies of the job working simultaneously, and each one gets a chunk of the input images rather than the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    ">During the backwards pass, gradients from each replica are summed into the original module.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then each of these duplicate tasks passes the results (the gradients) back home to the original! The learning is happening out in the workers/child processes, and then they all return the results to the original module/training process to be aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential difference with DDP, then, is that it is optimized for multiple machines instead of a single machine with multiple threads. It’s able to communicate across difference machines effectively, so we can use a GPU cluster for our computation.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Send Tasks to Workers\n",
    " \n",
    "We talked in Notebook 2 about how we distribute tasks to the workers in our cluster, and now you get to see it firsthand. Inside the `dispatch.run()` function in `dask-pytorch-ddp`, we are actually using the `client.submit()` method to pass tasks to our workers, and collecting these as futures in a list. We can prove this by looking at the results, here named \"futures\", where we can see they are in fact all pending futures, one for each of the workers in our cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why don't we use `.map()` in this function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that `.map` allows the Cluster to decide where the tasks are completed - it has the ability to choose which worker is assigned any task. That means that we don't have the control we need to ensure that we have one and only one job per GPU. This could be a problem for our methodology because of the use of DDP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we use `.submit` and manually assign it to the workers by number. This way, each worker is attacking the same problem - our transfer learning problem - and pursuing a solution simultaneously. We'll have one and only one job per worker."
